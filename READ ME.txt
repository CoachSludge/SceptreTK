These are tools that I've made.
They do exactly what they are intended to do.
Will need AutoHotKey which was used for the build.

Game assistant was an attempt to collab several tools involving hud and general keybinds, however they can somtimes fight with the other apps such as the recoil-assist. Works well with multibind games such as arma and squad.

Recoil-assist and auto-click can somtimes fight each other and usually can only allow one active at a time.

Bhop is a space bar macro for CS and minecraft.

CrosshairV.1 was very powerful but the keybinds would bug out with other apps active. 
Built CrosshairV.2 which uses f10 and f11.

CS Anti-Recoil matches recoil patterns almost 95% acuracy.
